	strings, numbers, Booleans, nulls, Undefineds,
	Symbols (unique identifiers for object keys),
	BigInt
	compared with "===" for value and type
weakly typed languages:
	coerces values from one type to another
	"5" == 5 is true in JS
function that takes unknown number of args
    function sumAll(...numbers) {
	return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
    }
    let sum = sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4);
Document Object Model (DOM)
	presents web page as tree-like structure of objects
	Each element (<div>, <ul>) becomes DOM object
		you can change.
    in HTML:
	<html><body><h1 id="title">Hey World<\h1><...

	let heading = document.getElementById("title");
	heading.textContent = "Cya L8r World";
Add Element with JS:
	let a = document.createElement("h1");
	a.textContent = "Hacker MEssaGe!!";
